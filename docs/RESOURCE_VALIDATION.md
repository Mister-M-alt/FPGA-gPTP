# Resource validation — the gPTP plane, measured 2026-08-14

The round that created this repository. The 2026-08-14 no-DDR3 resource
study priced "gPTP engine in fabric" as an ESTIMATE (+1,500…+2,500 LUT,
central +1,900). This page replaces that line with a measurement, on the
same instrument as every protocol-processor anchor: Vivado 2026.1,
`xc7a100tfgg484-2`, out-of-context synthesis at 100 MHz, post-synthesis
(hierarchical) utilization. That instrument's OOC-vs-real-SoC calibration
was accurate to one LUT on the AECP plane.

Reproduce: `syn/ooc/run.sh` (reports land in `syn/ooc/work/`).

## The µCPU: arithmetic ISA growth = +631 LUT

`KL_gptp_ucpu` is a pure superset of the AECP µCPU — every base port and
decode arm kept — so the delta prices the growth alone (OP_ALU: 64-bit
ADD/SUB/AND/OR/XOR + serial SHL/SHR/SAR; OP_MULDIV: DSP MULS 32×32→64 +
restoring DIVU 64/32→64):

| | AECP µCPU (record, 2026-08-13) | gPTP µCPU | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slice LUTs | 1,070 (938 logic + 132 LUTRAM) | **1,701** (1,569 + 132) | **+631** |
| Registers | 491 | 734 | +243 |
| BRAM tiles | 3 (2048 × 48 ROM) | **1.5** (1024 × 48 ROM) | **−1.5** |
| DSP48E1 | 0 | 4 (the 32×32 multiply) | +4 |
| WNS at 100 MHz, OOC | +2.586 ns | +1.949 ns, met | |

The serial shifter and the restoring divider are the deliberate trade:
every gPTP computation runs at protocol rate (≤ 8 Hz, and Milan v1.2
4.2.6.2.6 relaxes the Pdelay turnaround to 15 ms), so one bit per cycle
costs latency nothing needs and saves the barrel/parallel structures.

## The whole engine: 2,878 LUT

`KL_gptp_engine` = parser + µCPU + TX slot + timer + region map + publish
wires, one clock domain, byte in / byte out:

| Instance | Module | LUT | LUTRAM | FF | BRAM | DSP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **KL_gptp_engine** | (top) | **2,878** | 284 | 2,164 | **1.5** | 4 |
| (own: region map, event queue, bank + scratch, publish regs) | | 168 | 128 | 784 | 0 | 0 |
| `u_parser` | `KL_gptp_rx_parser` | 519 | 0 | 267 | 0 | 0 |
| `u_timer` | `KL_gptp_timer` | 264 | 0 | 321 | 0 | 0 |
| `u_txslot` | `KL_gptp_tx_slot` | 72 | 24 | 62 | 0 | 0 |
| `u_ucpu` | `KL_gptp_ucpu` | 1,855 | 132 | 730 | 1.5 | 4 |

WNS at 100 MHz, OOC: **+1.898 ns, 0 failing endpoints**. Zero critical
warnings in either synthesis log.

(The µCPU reads 1,855 in context vs 1,701 standalone — cross-boundary
optimization variance of the same kind the protocol-processor record
documents in the other direction.)

## What this does to the no-DDR3 study

The study's gPTP line moves from ESTIMATE +1,900 (bracket 1,500…2,500) to
**MEASURED 2,878** — the estimate was optimistic by roughly 1,000 LUT, and
the point of building this skeleton was to find that out before anyone
spent the plan. Two consequences, stated honestly:

1. The study's central landing moves from ≈25,900 to **≈26,900 LUT
   (−47%, was −49%)** against the 51,029 baseline. The −50% target is
   still inside the bracket but now REQUIRES the named reserve list
   (SRP `N_VIDS`/depth parameters, SRP encoder/decoder sharing, the
   deeper `milan_csr` decode diet, monitor BRAM-ification, full
   `rx_filter` deletion): with reserves the landing is ≈24,600…25,600
   (−50%…−52%).
2. On the other side of the ledger the skeleton UNDER-runs its budgets:
   BRAM 1.5 tiles vs 2 budgeted, and the whole plane closes timing with
   1.9 ns to spare with no floorplanning.

Against the alternatives table: the shared infrastructure (parser, timer,
slot, glue = 1,023 LUT) is common to EVERY implementation option — only
the compute element varies. A SERV-class bit-serial RV32 in place of the
µCPU would put the engine near 1,700…2,000 LUT at the price of moving all
protocol logic into C firmware; a bare-metal VexiiRiscv variant remains
the most expensive option and is now measurably unjustified.

## What is NOT in the 2,878

- **The 802.1AS state machines of record.** The entry handlers are real
  first cuts that exercise every datapath (they are what keeps synthesis
  from folding anything), but BTCA, the asCapable ladder, the receipt
  timeouts and the Milan profile numbers are µcode still to be written.
  µcode costs ROM words, not LUTs — the ROM has 904 of 1,024 words free —
  but if the full state set outgrows 1,024 words, the next ROM step is
  2048 × 48 = 3 tiles (+1.5).
- **Integration glue in the parent**: the 0x88F7 leg on the KL_pp_shadow
  classifier, the TX cascade port, the CSR debug window, possibly a
  second message bank if double-buffering is wanted. Expect +100…+400 LUT
  at the milan_datapath boundary.
- **The egress-timestamp plumbing** already exists in the parent
  (`ptp_ts_top`); this repo only consumes it.

## Verification state at this measurement

- `tb/verilator/ucpu`: 768 checks green against an independent C++ model
  (directed edges + 64 random operand pairs), mutation-proven.
- `tb/verilator/parser`: 31 checks green (Announce + path trace, Sync,
  Follow_Up + information TLV, Pdelay_Resp, five drop arms),
  mutation-proven. This suite caught three real field-straddle bugs and
  an end-of-frame race before synthesis — the harness money worked.
- `verilator --lint-only -Wall` clean on the engine top.
