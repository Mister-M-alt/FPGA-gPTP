"""How a suite's OWN output answers, read once for every mutation arm.

A mutation arm is only evidence if "caught" means the harness said so. A
non-zero exit on its own is not a catch: a mutant that makes the design abort,
hang, or die by a signal has told us nothing about the assertions - it has only
told us the mutant is broken, which we already knew. So the verdict is read
from the tally line and the FAIL lines both suites already print, and every
other outcome is named as what it is rather than counted as success.
