"""Mutation arm for the engine suite: prove its checks are load-bearing.

Why this exists. `sim_main.cpp` grades the whole plane through its wire and
publish faces, and the arms that repair FPGA-gPTP #31 - the accepted-beat
result face, the message-scoped lost arm, the retained Pdelay pairing
context and the three admission gates - are exactly the kind of behaviour a
harness can appear to check without checking. A suite whose assertions never
fail is indistinguishable from a suite that asserts nothing, and the defect
this round repairs was invisible to a green suite for that reason.

So the real engine RTL and the real micro-code generator are mutated, one
defect at a time, and the SAME harness is run against each mutant. Every
mutant must make it FAIL. The unmutated build must still PASS, without which
the arm would be satisfied by a harness that fails on everything.

"Caught" means the harness's own tally says so; see tb/mutation_verdict.py
for why a non-zero exit alone is not a catch. Everything is staged into a
temporary directory, so nothing is written into the tree.

Cost note, recorded rather than hidden: micro-code mutants reuse one build of
the unmutated RTL, because a generator change moves only the ROM image the
simulation reads at start-up. RTL mutants are built individually.

What this arm deliberately does NOT list, recorded rather than hidden,
because the value of a mutation arm is also the map of what it cannot reach.
Removing the reset-backed read gate on the pending-pair cell alone survives
every check, and that survival is a property of the design rather than a gap
in the harness: the cell is read in only two places, and a new Pdelay_Req
clears it at its commit point before any post-reset timestamp result can
match a claim. The gate is kept because it is the second half of a stated
rule that pairs it with the t1 validity beside it, whose own removal IS
caught below; it is defence in depth with no reachable arm, not a checked
behaviour. Closing that would need a reachable state, not another mutant.

The lapse hook's asCapable term is also defence in depth. Removing only
that term survives: Sync pairs cannot be consumed while incapable, and
the 375 ms Sync receipt watch clears sync-ok before capability can recover
through two good Pdelay exchanges at 1 s cadence. Only mastership disarms
that watch, and mastership retires the qualifier itself. This is a
reachability argument from the current policy, not an executed proof;
revisit it if the timer or capability recovery rules change.
